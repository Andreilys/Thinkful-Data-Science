# test schedule the same, if so can we reschedule?
Book ~``

# groups was difficult, cryptography was challenging
# material on orderings is pretty difficult
# tests are mostly indepndent (talk about most recent material)
The negation of "all" is "there exists some" integer.
For the sum of 2 even integers is even, the negation
is not the sum of 2 even integers is odd. It's actually there exists
some x and y, such that x is even, y is even, x+y is odd
